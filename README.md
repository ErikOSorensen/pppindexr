# pppindexr

Price and Quantity Indices for International Comparisons: The EKS, CCD,
and the Geary-Khamis real income indices.

Rudimentary functionality and some unit tests are implemented.

## Installation

You can install the development version of pppindexr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ErikOSorensen/pppindexr")
```

## Example

Let us look at a 2x2 example (two countries of equal size, two goods)
and define some arbitrary prices and quantities (one row per country):

``` r
library(pppindexr)
ex1 <- data.frame(
  population = c(1, 1),
  p1 = c(1, 1),
  p2 = c(1, 1),
  q1 = c(1, 1),
  q2 = c(3, 1)
)
# EKS index and Gheary Khamis:
ex1$eks = eks(ex1[, 2:3], ex1[, 4:5])
ex1$gk  = gk(ex1[, 2:3], ex1[, 4:5], pop = ex1$pop)$y
ex1
#>   population p1 p2 q1 q2 eks gk
#> 1          1  1  1  1  3   2  4
#> 2          1  1  1  1  1   1  2
```

We can see that the Gheary-Khamis is normalized such that one countryâ€™s
real income is set to 1, while the EKS index needs to be scaled to be
directly compared.
